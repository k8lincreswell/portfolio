        <h2>2023, projection onto canvas, 100x100cm</h2>
          <h2>gradients was born from my first ever interest in making an audiovisual installation. i, for the first time, was reconnecting with my love of sound, and at the same time pursued communicating my belief that everything in life is a gradient. the canvas i used in order to project the gradients onto was the backside of the canvas used for my beloved painting, julia. *the audio is intended to be listened to using either headphones or a speaker.</h2>

        <h1>jack in the box (remastered 2023)</h1>
        <h2>2023, projection</h2>
          <h2>this installation was created in order to challenge the viewer’s perception of something that has most likely remained unchanged and untouched in their mind for years. this installation aims to deconstruct and reconstruct the relationship between the object and its accompanying sound. in fact, this installation takes the presence of a common sound from an accompaniment, to the main focus, as the listener can find themself confused as to what altered audio they are listening to. it will no longer be the version of “pop! goes the weasel” they were used to. this installation will take place in a square and dark room with four walls, each receiving a projection of the video playing simultaneously to one another.</h2>

        <h1>birdsong (remastered 2024)</h1>
        <h2>2024, audio sculpture proposal for giardini indro montanelli, milano</h2>
          <h2>birdsong (remastered 2024) was a boundary i pushed. i was instructed by my professor to create a sculpture proposal for a public park, which i did, but as an audio sculpture, rather than visual. the goal was to alter the perception and raise the curiosity and awareness of any passerbys. i took the approach of taking birdsbong, and turning it robotic. you can click on the image to view the video documentation.</h2>

        <h1>canvas (remastered 2024)</h1>
        <h2>2024, projection on curtain and easel</h2>
          <h2>canvas (remastered 2024) embodies the ghost of a painting; of what was, or of what could have been. with the art world constantly evolving beyond a standard of recollective painting, putting its pressures elsewhere, the concept of making a painting becomes altered. this installation aims to bridge a gap, and relieve a source of pressure from what a painting is allowed to present itself as. it gives a new idea to how a physical painting can function, and how it can be physical in a different manner from what is known. pressure will only confine a painting. this project marries various aspects to provide a lighter approach to achieving a painting. taking a sheer curtain draped over an easel, projecting an abstract painting of black and white paint strokes, creating movement with a fan positioned underneath, and concluding with the audio aspect of a repetitive melody, canvas (remastered 2024) reveals itself to be an audiovisual installation yearning to be a painting, and as a painting yearning to be an audiovisual installation. you can click on the image to view the video documentation.</h2>

        <h1>being alive is the special occasion</h1>
        <h2>2023, public installation of streamers, balloons, and ribbon on a balcony</h2>
          <h2>being alive is the special occasion was a step out of my comfort zone. it was a concept that i was allowing anyone and everyone to see, and it was a concept that was not the most intricate, nor developed. this public act was the accumulation of an urgency to communicate that, even in the grayest of moments, it is being alive in itself which is a special occasion enough. the goal was to resemble the remnants of a party or celebration, amidst the background of my gray apartment building with stand-offish closed shutters, and the foreground of the barren winter trees.</h2>
