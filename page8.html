         mother mary (remastered 2023) was a one-hour long, intimate performance resulting from a collaboration between seven friends, all who wished to pick at the way religion existed in each of their upbringings, and the way in which it has bled into their present selves. as a five act talent show taking place in a private space, the exact mood that may have existed in the room is up to one’s own imagination. scapegoating religion was the excuse to create this particular situation of combining humor and intimacy.

         MOTHER MARY (Remastered 2023) was a private performance, comparable to a theatrical piece, that took place in the comfort of my dear home. This piece was the result of an idea formulated by a group of friends and I: to host an intimate talent show, where each person must present a(n) talent/act related to the way in which religion has influenced their upbringing, or to represent a remnant they hold from the presence of religion in their upbringing. 
          I decided to pursue this theorized performance; I gathered a cast of six people who created a total of five acts within the show, and an audience of the same people in addition to one more, the photographer, to document the performance on a Canon Prima AF-9s with 35mm Kodak film. 
          The documentation by Frida Olsborg consists of ten photos, highlighting the set and props used, and displaying the cast of myself, Kaitlin Creswell, along with Carolina Garcez, Sarah Zamichieli, Carter Denton, Andrea Marchetto, and Andrea Occhetta. The set was based in a corner of my kitchen, cleared of all furniture (except for two acts that required a table), daintily decorated with bows, ribbon, and fairy lights, while using a spotlight focused on the main subject’s area. The assortment of props consisted of Ho’oponopono beads, a Santa Claus costume, the book What the Buddha Taught, The Bible, a cross, a cake, cake frosting, birthday candles, mantra papers, bread, a cup of water, a portrait of Jesus, and a bed sheet. A speaker was used to play music accordingly, as requested by individual acts. Calming meditation music was played during the buddhist meditation ritual, upbeat royalty free music was used during the cake decorating act, “Take me to Church” by Hozier was played as the audience was led through confession, and during a reenactment of the rise and fall of Jesus Christ, Gregorian chant music was played to set an intense mood. 
          This one hour long, script-less performance was the ultimate collaboration of ignorance, gathered from Americans, Italians, a Brazilian, and a Norwegian who never took care amidst their upbringing, or afterwards, to recall what is correct and what is not, or what they choose to follow or not. Random ideas (with the general theme of course of religion and our upbringings, and a small handful of directed moments) are what built these performances, and that was the point. In this intimate setting, there was no need to tiptoe around concepts. The way in which each individual performance was delivered and received held a very lighthearted and hilarious aura. It was all occurring within a group in which each member had equally consented (a form was distributed about a month prior to collect everyone’s consent to taking part in/witnessing a potentially offensive performance), and each with an equivalent inherent nature to result in no offense being taken. 
          A performance of this nature certainly could have occurred in a public setting, in a more outward manner, but with that choice, the sense of unapologetic intimacy within the humor would have been entirely lost. As this documentation consisting of still, audio-less images is all there is to show in a public setting now, it is up to one’s imagination, the intricacies of the humor, the level of offense one may wish to take. But what rings the loudest of this piece, is that during this hour of performance, in this one room, all preconceptions were left behind as one tried to delight another, with careless references used to curate this particular and ephemeral humor, that cannot be recreated in the same manner in any other setting.
