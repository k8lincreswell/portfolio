          <h2>this video was realized in iceland, when, after months of not escaping the city, i was met with empty landscapes, fresh air, and some of the most shockingly beautiful sights i had ever seen. it was a time of pause, reflection, quiet, and recovery. this project was an attempt to convey the somber yet becoming state of mind i was in during this trip.</h2>

          <h2>originally a class exercise, i ended up taking this video a step further by gracing it with poetry i had written yet never intended to share. this was my first experimentation with words in my work.</h2>
